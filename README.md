Total time taken by method-2 is 5 seconds

Total time taken by method-1 is 9 seconds
Total time taken by method-2 is 8 seconds

Total time taken by method-1 is 8 seconds
Total time taken by method-2 is 5 seconds

Total time taken by method-1 is 8 seconds
Total time taken by method-2 is 5 seconds
```
